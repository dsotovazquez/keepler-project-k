<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Execution Environment

For each problem, there will be one or more input files, each according to the specifications mentioned in the problem statement, and corresponding correct output files. 
Your program is run on each of those input files. The output generated by your program must match the correct output exactly in order to be judged correct.

If your program starts by printing 'Enter the number' and the problem does not tell you to do so, then since this is not part of the correct output, you will be never be 
judged correct regardless of what the rest of your program does

As all that matters is that the output files match, it makes no difference at all at what point in your program's execution that this output is written.

So there is no need to read all of the input before starting output; it is much more common to just print out each result as you are reading through the input. If you use 
any method other than using the standard input and output streams - for example, using command line arguments, reading from a file, opening up some sort of dialog box, or 
otherwise - you will never be judged correct.


### Time Limit Work

Your program must read, process, and output the result for all input files within the specified time limit. The input file will be of the format mentioned in the problem.
This means, if each of the input file contains multiple test cases, your code must complete all of these within that time limit. If the time limit is 1 second, and there may be 100 test cases and multiple input files, your program shouldn't be taking 1 second per test case - it needs to run all 100 in under 1 seconds. Some programming languages are slower than others, and are thus given more time. Also all the input files are processed, irrespective of whether the first input file passed or not.

### Total Execution Time

Your code is tested multiple times with different input files. The execution time displayed is the total of the time spent for each input file. But your program is 
terminated if it exceeds the time limit mentioned in the problem while processing any input file. Hence, Total execution time <= (Time Limit * Number of input files)

### Total Memory Consumed

Total memory consumed by the program is sum of the memory consumed by program in stack, data, heap, and bss. See this image or this explanation to understand the address space of a program and the memory consumed.

Note that for languages like Java, Scala, JavaScript, etc. where runtime environment is initialized before the program could be executed, the total memory displayed could be much higher. Hence the memory limit is usually not considered for these languages, except in extreme cases where the program is consuming too much of memory.

### Local Testing

Testing your program in exactly the same way that online judge does. Create an input file and then run your program from the command line, using < and > to redirect the 
streams. For example: ./a.out < input > output Your program will read input from the input file and print output in the output file. You can check if the output format is 
correct in the output file. It should exactly match the output format give in the problem statment.

### Requirements

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [Node.js v10.15.3]
* [python 3.5.2
* [gnu bash v4.3.11]
* [Java openjdk 1.7.0_95]
* [Scala  scalac 2.12.2]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

### Preparing the Local Environment

To prepare the local environment, I have used a mysql docker image based in Debian 10 
We have to install the same python runtime that we are executing in the hackerearth.com

The Judge Environment documentation (https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/judge/) specifies the 3.5.3 version for Python3.



The python runtime 


### Database

https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql
docker pull mysql
docker swarm init

We define the docker mysql stack in the stack.yaml file and deploy the stack:

docker stack deploy -c stack.yaml mysql
